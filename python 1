	- Code resembles the English language which 
	- computers understand python through a Python interpreter
	- Strong emphasis on code readability and simplicity (this allows programmers to develop applications rapidly)

Why Python?
	- Easy to read
	- All high level languages (C, C++ and Java) are very similar to each other
